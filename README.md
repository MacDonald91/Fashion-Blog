Everyday with Isa: An Insider's Guide to NYFW
Welcome to the Everyday with Isa project! This repository showcases a detailed, single-page HTML blog post, "An Insider's Guide to NYFW," authored by Isabelle Rodriguez. This project serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental web development concepts, offering valuable insights into structuring and presenting rich content using clean HTML.

This project was specifically developed as a hands-on exercise during the Codecademy Full-Stack Web Development Course, solidifying fundamental web development concepts crucial for aspiring web developers.

Project Structure
This project is intentionally lean, focusing on a clear and functional HTML implementation:

index.html: The primary file, containing the entire semantic structure and engaging content of the blog post.
media/: A dedicated directory housing all image assets used within the blog post, including:
media/pic1.png
media/pic2.png
media/pic3.png
media/pic4.png
Key Features & Development Highlights
This project demonstrates several essential front-end development techniques:

Semantic HTML5 Structure: The blog post is built with appropriate HTML5 tags (e.g., <header>, <article>, <section>, <footer>) to ensure accessibility, SEO, and maintainable code.
Responsive Image Integration: Images are efficiently embedded using the <img> tag, complete with descriptive alt attributes for accessibility and improved user experience.
Internal & External Navigation: Both external hyperlinks (e.g., to Wikipedia) and internal anchor links (from the author's image to contact info) are implemented using the <a> tag, demonstrating effective page navigation.
Content Organization: The content is logically segmented using various heading levels (<h1> to <h4>), paragraphs (<p>), and unordered lists (<ul>, <li>) for enhanced readability and structured data.
Clean & Maintainable Code: The HTML is written to be straightforward and easy to understand, reflecting best practices for basic web page development.
Setup & Local Development
To run and explore this project locally:

Clone the Repository: Use git clone [repository-url] to download the project files to your local machine.
Navigate to Project Directory: cd [your-project-folder]
Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. Alternatively, if you have a local development server (like Live Server in VS Code), you can serve the file for real-time updates.
Technologies Used
This project leverages fundamental web development tools:

HTML5: The backbone for content structuring and presentation.
Visual Studio Code: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing and debugging the HTML code.
Git & GitHub: Utilized for version control, allowing for tracking changes, collaboration, and repository management.
GitHub Pages: This project is easily deployable via GitHub Pages, providing a simple way to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository.
Learning Outcomes
This project provided an excellent opportunity to solidify key front-end development principles, particularly:

Deepening understanding of semantic HTML5 for robust and accessible web page construction.
Mastering image embedding and the importance of alt attributes for web standards.
Proficiency in creating effective hyperlinks for both external resources and internal page navigation.
Developing skills in content organization using various HTML elements to improve readability and user flow.
